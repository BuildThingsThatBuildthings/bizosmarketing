## 📣 The Script

### Opening (2 minutes)

"Hey [Name], thanks for jumping on. I know you're busy running [Company], so I'll respect your time.

I've got 30 minutes blocked here. My goal is to understand what's going on in your business, see if what we do even makes sense for you, and if it does, show you exactly how it works.

If it's not a fit, I'll tell you straight up and point you in the right direction. Sound fair?

Before we dive in - what made you book this call today?"

### Discovery Questions (10 minutes)

**Current State**
1. "Walk me through your current operations - what does a typical week look like?"
2. "What systems or tools are you using now to manage everything?"
3. "How many hours per week are you spending on admin/operations?"

**Pain Points**
4. "What's the biggest operational headache you're dealing with right now?"
5. "What's that costing you - in time, money, or missed opportunities?"
6. "How long has this been a problem?"

**Desired State**
7. "If you could wave a magic wand, what would your operations look like?"
8. "What would change in your business if this was solved?"
9. "What's preventing you from having that now?"

**Urgency/Timeline**
10. "What happens if nothing changes in the next 90 days?"
11. "Why is solving this important now versus later?"
12. "Have you tried fixing this before? What happened?"

### Transition to Demo

"Based on what you've told me about [repeat their pain], I think I can help. Let me show you exactly how our Business Operating System would work for your specific situation..."

### Demo Points (5 minutes)

1. **Show, Don't Tell**
   - Screen share actual system
   - Use their business as example
   - Focus on their biggest pain

2. **Key Features to Highlight**
   - GitHub repository structure
   - YAML personalization
   - Specific templates they need
   - Automation possibilities

3. **ROI Calculation**
   "You said you're spending 20 hours/week on operations. At $100/hour, that's $8,000/month. Our system cuts that by 75%, saving you $6,000/month. The investment is $97 one-time."

### Investment Discussion (5 minutes)

"So here's how this works...

**Option 1: BOS Starter - $97**
- Complete system access
- Video implementation guides
- Community support
- Lifetime updates
- Perfect if you're comfortable with self-implementation

**Option 2: BOS Pro - $497**

Most people in your situation go with [recommend based on their needs] because [specific reason]."

### Closing Questions (3 minutes)

**Assumptive Close**
"Based on everything we've discussed, this seems like exactly what you need to [achieve their goal]. Which option feels right for you - Starter or Pro?"

**If Hesitation**
"I'm sensing some hesitation. What questions do you have that I haven't answered?"

**Common Objections**

*"I need to think about it"*
"I totally get it. What specifically do you need to think through? Often it helps to talk it out while we're here together."

*"I need to talk to my partner"*
"Makes sense. What do you think their main questions will be? Let's make sure you have all the info they'll want."

*"I don't have time to implement"*
"That's exactly why you need this. How much time are you wasting now because you DON'T have systems? This saves time from week one."

*"It seems too cheap to be good"*
"I get that a lot. We make money on volume and future products, not consulting fees. Plus, check out these success stories [share 2-3]."

### Next Steps (2 minutes)

**If Yes**
"Awesome! I'll send you the order form right now. Once you complete it, you'll get instant access and we can schedule your first implementation call."

**If Maybe**
"I understand you need time. I'll hold your spot for 48 hours - after that, the price goes up to $197. What day/time works to reconnect?"

**If No**
"No worries at all. Just curious for my own learning - what would have needed to be different for this to be a fit?"

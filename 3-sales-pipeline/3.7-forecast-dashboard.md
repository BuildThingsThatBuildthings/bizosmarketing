## 🎯 Forecasting Methodology

### Weighted Pipeline Method

| Stage | Historical Conversion | Weight | Formula |
|-------|----------------------|--------|----------|
| New Lead | 20% | 0.20 | Value × 0.20 |
| Qualified | 30% | 0.30 | Value × 0.30 |
| Discovery | 45% | 0.45 | Value × 0.45 |
| Proposal | 65% | 0.65 | Value × 0.65 |
| Negotiation | 85% | 0.85 | Value × 0.85 |

### Forecast Calculation
```
Monthly Forecast = Σ(Deals in Stage × Stage Value × Conversion Weight)

Example:
- New Leads: 85 × $97 × 0.20 = $1,649
- Qualified: 45 × $297 × 0.30 = $4,010
- Discovery: 20 × $397 × 0.45 = $3,573
- Proposal: 12 × $497 × 0.65 = $3,876
- Negotiation: 8 × $497 × 0.85 = $3,380

Total Forecast = $16,488
```

## 📈 Pipeline Velocity Metrics

### Average Deal Velocity
```
Velocity = (# of Deals × Average Value × Conversion Rate) / Sales Cycle Length

Current: (100 × $297 × 23%) / 14 days = $487/day
```

# Sales Pipeline – System Blueprint

## 🧠 Purpose

Transform interested prospects into paying customers through a systematic, predictable process. Your sales pipeline is where revenue becomes reality, not hope.

## ✅ Must-Haves

* **CRM properly configured** with stages and automation
* **Discovery call framework** that uncovers real needs
* **Proposal templates** that practically sell themselves
* **Follow-up sequences** that persist without pestering
* **Clear metrics** at every stage of the funnel

## 🌟 Nice-to-Haves

* Advanced lead scoring
* Multi-touch attribution
* Automated contract generation
* Commission calculators
* Predictive analytics

## 🧨 Distractions

* Complex sales processes for simple products
* Over-automating human touchpoints
* Chasing unqualified leads
* Discounting instead of value-building
* Pipeline reports without action

## 🧭 OODA Orientation

**Observe** – Conversion rates, cycle time, drop-off points  
**Orient** – Bottlenecks, objection patterns, winning messages  
**Decide** – Process improvements, script updates, tool changes  
**Act** – Test new approaches, train team, optimize flow

# Awareness Email Series - 5-Part Sequence

*Hook-Retain-Reward format that turns cold leads into eager buyers*

## ðŸ“§ Email 1: The Wake-Up Call
**Subject**: You're losing $3,847/month to operational chaos (here's proof)  
**Send**: Immediately after opt-in

```
Hey {{first_name}},

Quick question: How many hours did you spend last week on "admin stuff" that didn't directly make you money?

If you're like most solo entrepreneurs, it's 15-20 hours. At $50/hour, that's $3,847/month in lost revenue.

Here's what that chaos really costs:
- Missed follow-ups = lost deals
- Scattered systems = repeated work  
- Manual processes = scaling ceiling

I started Build Things That Build Things because I watched too many brilliant entrepreneurs drown in their own success.

Tomorrow, I'll show you the exact framework that turned my 60-hour weeks into 30-hour weeks while doubling revenue.

Talk soon,
Ryan

P.S. This isn't about working harder. It's about building systems that work harder than you.

## ðŸ“§ Email 2: The Success Story
**Subject**: From 60-hour weeks to 4-day workweeks (Sarah's story)  
**Send**: Day 2

```
{{first_name}},

Sarah was drowning. 

$12K/month in revenue, but working until 2am every night just to keep up.

Her breaking point? Missing her daughter's recital because of "urgent" client emails.

That's when she implemented our Business Operating System. In 90 days:
- Automated 80% of follow-ups
- Cut admin time from 20 to 4 hours/week
- Scaled to $31K/month working 4 days/week

The secret? She stopped treating her business like a job and started building it like a machine.

Here's the framework she used:
1. **Systematize** - Document every process once
2. **Automate** - Let technology handle repetition
3. **Delegate** - Focus only on $500/hour tasks
4. **Scale** - Multiply what works, kill what doesn't

Tomorrow, I'll break down the exact GitHub-based system she used.

Systems > Hustle,
Ryan

P.S. Sarah's not special. She just had the right framework. You can too.

## ðŸ“§ Email 3: The How-To
**Subject**: Your business on autopilot in 3 steps  
**Send**: Day 3

```
{{first_name}},

Want to know why consultants charge $50K for basic business systems?

Because they're selling complexity, not solutions.

Here's how we do it for $97:

**Step 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
- Clone our GitHub repository
- Fill in your business variables
- Deploy your personalized system

**Step 2: Implementation (Week 2-4)**  
- Install growth engine automations
- Set up sales pipeline workflows
- Configure customer success sequences

**Step 3: Optimization (Ongoing)**
- Track what's working with built-in analytics
- A/B test everything
- Scale winners, kill losers

The entire system lives in GitHub because:
- Version control = never lose progress
- Collaboration = your whole team stays aligned
- Automation = push button, update everywhere

No consultants. No complexity. Just systems that scale.

Tomorrow, I'll show you exactly what's included.

Build systems, not chaos,
Ryan

P.S. This same system runs our entire business. We eat our own dog food.

## Email 1: The $50K PDF Scam (Immediately)

**Subject:** The $50,000 PowerPoint I stole from McKinsey

**Preview:** (and turned into a $97 GitHub repo)

Hey [Name],

True story:

Last year, I watched a friend pay Deloitte $75,000 for a "business transformation."

Know what he got?

- 16 weeks of meetings
- 247-page PDF
- 5 generic templates
- A consultant who ghosted him

His business today? Still running on spreadsheets and prayer.

Meanwhile, I took everything consultants charge for...

Ripped out the BS...

And put it in a GitHub repo.

**The result?**

My entire business runs from one repository:
- Marketing automation that actually works
- Sales pipeline I can track with git log  
- Financial dashboards that update themselves
- 10 operational domains, fully integrated

Total cost: $97.
Implementation time: 4 hours.
Consultants who hate me: All of them.

Tomorrow, I'll show you the exact repo structure that replaced my $50K consultant quote.

But first, quick question:

**What's the most painful part of running your business right now?**

Hit reply and let me know. I read every email.

-Ryan

P.S. If you're tired of duct-taping tools together while consultants buy yachts, you're in the right place.

## Email 2: The Repo Tour (Day 2)

**Subject:** Here's what's inside a $97 business operating system

**Preview:** (warning: consultants will try to stop you from seeing this)

[Name],

Yesterday I mentioned putting my entire business in a GitHub repo.

People think I'm crazy. Until they see this:

```
business-operating-system/
├── 0-foundation/          # Your business DNA
├── 1-market-intel/        # Know your market cold
├── 2-growth-engine/       # Marketing that scales
├── 3-sales-pipeline/      # Sales without the sleaze
├── 4-delivery-success/    # Happy customers who stay
├── 5-product-innovation/  # Build what they want
├── 6-finance-admin/       # Know your numbers
├── 7-people-culture/      # Team that performs
├── 8-tech-stack/         # Tools that integrate
└── 9-governance/         # Always improving
```

But here's the magic:

Every file uses YAML variables.

Change your company name ONCE.
Updates EVERYWHERE.

**Example:**
```yaml
company_name: "Your Business"
owner_name: "You"
primary_market: "Your Market"
```

Run the personalization script.

BOOM. Your entire business system, customized.

No more:
- 17 different tools
- Scattered Google Docs
- "Where did I put that?"
- Working 60-hour weeks

**Just:**
- One repo
- Version controlled
- Automated workflows  
- 30-hour weeks

Tomorrow, I'll show you how Sarah (consultant, was paying $3K/month for tools) replaced everything with our GitHub OS.

Spoiler: She saved $35,640 per year.

Still running your business from spreadsheets?

-Ryan

P.S. McKinsey charges $125K for what I'm about to show you. You'll get it for $97. They're... upset.

## Email 3: The Sarah Case Study (Day 4)

**Subject:** How Sarah fired her $50K consultant (and doubled revenue)

**Preview:** From 60-hour weeks to 30, with one GitHub repo

[Name],

Meet Sarah:
- Business consultant (ironic, right?)
- $8K/month revenue
- Working 60+ hours
- 14 different tools
- Drowning in her own success

She hired a "business systemization expert" for $50K.

Three months later?

Pretty PDFs. Zero implementation. Still drowning.

Then she found our GitHub Business OS.

**Day 1:** Cloned the repo
**Day 2:** Customized with her details  
**Day 7:** Entire business systematized
**Day 30:** Working 30 hours/week
**Day 90:** Revenue at $16K/month

Her exact words:

"I showed my $50K consultant your $97 system. He said 'don't tell anyone about this.' That's when I knew it was gold."

**What Sarah implemented first:**

1. **2-growth-engine/email-sequences/**
   - Automated her entire nurture flow
   - Conversion rate: 8% → 24%

2. **3-sales-pipeline/proposal-builder/**
   - Proposals in 5 minutes, not 2 hours
   - Close rate: 30% → 65%

3. **4-delivery-success/onboarding/**
   - Client onboarding on autopilot
   - Time saved: 10 hours/week

**The kicker?**

She white-labels our system for HER clients now.

Charges them $5K.

They think she's a genius.

(She kind of is - she bought our system)

Want to see the exact email sequence that doubled Sarah's revenue?

I'll share it tomorrow. Word for word.

-Ryan

P.S. Sarah's consultant? Still sending her invoices. She frames them for motivation.

## Email 4: The Million Dollar Email Sequence (Day 7)

**Subject:** Copy/paste this email sequence (made Sarah $96K)

**Preview:** Steal word-for-word what works

Ok [Name],

As promised, here's the exact email sequence Sarah used.

Revenue before: $8K/month
Revenue after: $16K/month
Time to implement: 37 minutes

**Email 1: The Problem Pattern**
```
Subject: The 3am panic attack every [THEIR ROLE] knows

You know that moment...

When you realize you're successful enough to be drowning
But not successful enough to hire help?

[DESCRIBE THEIR EXACT PAIN]

Tomorrow, I'll show you how I fixed this.
```

**Email 2: The Possibility**
```
Subject: What if your business ran without you?

[Show them what's possible]
[Use specific numbers]
[Make it feel achievable]
```

**Email 3: The Proof**
```
Subject: [CASE STUDY NAME] did it in 7 days

[Real customer]
[Real results]
[Real timeline]
```

Notice the pattern?

Problem they FEEL → Possibility they WANT → Proof they BELIEVE

This sequence is in our GitHub OS at:
`2-growth-engine/2.3-consideration-nurture/email-sequences/`

Along with 47 other proven sequences.

All in markdown.
All customizable.
All tested.

**But here's what matters:**

Sarah didn't write these from scratch.

She copied ours.
Customized for her market.
Launched in ConvertKit.

Result: $96K in extra revenue this year.

Cost: $97.

Starting to see why consultants hate us?

Tomorrow, I'll show you the biggest lie consultants tell.

(Hint: It's about "customization")

-Ryan

P.S. This email sequence? It's email-sequences/awareness-series.md in the repo. Ready to copy/paste/profit.

## Email 5: The Customization Lie (Day 9)

**Subject:** Why McKinsey doesn't want you reading this

**Preview:** The truth about "custom solutions"

[Name],

Biggest lie in consulting:

"Your business needs a CUSTOM solution."

BS.

Know what consultants actually do?

1. Use the same templates for everyone
2. Change your company name
3. Adjust some percentages
4. Charge you $50K
5. Call it "bespoke"

I know because I've seen their "proprietary frameworks."

They're GitHub repos.
With variables.
Just like ours.

Except theirs cost $50,000.
Ours costs $97.

**The difference?**

We're honest about it.

Our YAML personalization:
```yaml
company_name: "Your Business"
target_market: "Your Market"
price_point: "Your Pricing"
tone_of_voice: "Your Voice"
```

Change these 4 lines.
Run `./personalize.sh`

Every document updates.
Every template customizes.
Every system aligns.

More "custom" than McKinsey.
99.8% cheaper.

**Real question:**

Do you want to pay for:
- Consultant's office lease?
- Their junior army?
- PowerPoint theater?
- First-class flights?

Or do you want:
- A system that works?
- That you own?
- That you can modify?
- For $97?

Thought so.

Tomorrow, I'll answer the #1 objection:
"But I need support!"

(Spoiler: Our community > Their ghosting)

-Ryan

P.S. A consultant DM'd me yesterday: "You're destroying our industry." I replied: "Good."

## Email 6: The Support Truth (Day 11)

**Subject:** What happens AFTER you pay (consultants vs us)

**Preview:** One ghosts you. One grows with you.

[Name],

Let's talk about AFTER you pay.

**Consultants (Month 1-3):**
- Weekly calls (billing you)
- Pretty slides (billing you)
- "Strategic alignment" (billing you)
- Deliver PDFs
- Disappear

**Consultants (Month 4+):**
- Won't return calls
- "That's out of scope"
- "You need Phase 2" ($$$)
- New junior on your account
- Good luck

**Us (Forever):**
- GitHub repo = you own it
- Community of 237+ entrepreneurs
- Weekly system improvements
- `git pull` for updates
- Actually sustainable

**Real support example:**

Yesterday in our Slack, Marcus asked:
"How do I modify the proposal template for SaaS?"

**17 minutes later:**
- 3 community members responded
- Shared their SaaS versions
- Linked to documentation
- Problem solved

Cost: $0
Time: 17 minutes
Result: Closed $5K deal

Try getting that from McKinsey.

**The truth:**

You don't need consultants.
You need systems.
You need community.
You need ownership.

All for $97.

Ready to join 237 entrepreneurs who chose freedom over dependency?

Tomorrow, I'll make you an offer.

And show you why 93% buy within 24 hours.

-Ryan

P.S. Our longest support thread? 847 comments. About automated invoicing. Someone built a Stripe integration. Shared with everyone. This is how we work.

$97. Once. Done.

Or...

Pay a consultant $50K.
Get PDFs.
Stay stuck.

Your choice.

-Ryan

P.S. Sarah from Email #3? She made her $97 back in 6 hours. Her first automated proposal closed a $2K deal while she slept. That's the power of systems.

P.P.S. Still skeptical? Reply with your biggest concern. I personally answer every email within 24 hours. Unlike consultants who bill you for breathing.

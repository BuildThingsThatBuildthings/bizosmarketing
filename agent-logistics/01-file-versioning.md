# File Versioning Guidelines

*Never lose progress, always move forward*

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Principle

Every file has a lifecycle: Create â†’ Update â†’ Fork â†’ Archive. Understanding when to use each action prevents chaos and preserves progress.

## ðŸ“Š Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Action | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **New asset, nothing similar exists** | Create | First landing page ever |
| **Minor fixes (<20% changes)** | Update | Fix typo, update metric |
| **Major revision (>20% changes)** | New version | v1 â†’ v2 |
| **Different use case** | Fork | Template â†’ Client-specific |
| **No longer needed** | Archive | Move to `/_archive/` |

## ðŸ”„ Version Numbering

### Standard Progression
- `v1` - Initial release
- `v2` - Major revision (structure change)
- `v3` - Another major revision
- `v1.1` - Minor update to v1
- `v2.1` - Minor update to v2

### When to Increment

**Major Version (v1 â†’ v2)**
- Structural changes
- New sections added
- Purpose shift
- Breaking changes

**Minor Version (v1 â†’ v1.1)**
- Content updates
- Small fixes
- Metric refreshes
- Typo corrections

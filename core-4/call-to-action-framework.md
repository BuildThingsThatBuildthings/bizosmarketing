## **Objection Pre-Emption**

### **"I need to think about it"**
> **Response:** "I understand. But here's what I know: thinking doesn't organize scattered processes. Action does. And every day you think about it costs you $82 in wasted time. The system is ready now. Your business organization can't wait."

### **"It's too expensive"**  
> **Response:** "Expensive compared to what? Losing $30K annually to operational chaos? Or paying a consultant $10K to build something custom? At $97, this pays for itself in the first week."

### **"I don't have time to implement"**
> **Response:** "You're already spending 15 hours/week on scattered operations. We're organizing that time, not adding to it. Plus, the first 30 minutes saves you 2 hours this week alone."

### **"How do I know it will work for my business?"**
> **Response:** "The frameworks are industry-agnostic because every business needs organized operations. Plus, you have 30 days to prove it works. Risk is entirely on us."

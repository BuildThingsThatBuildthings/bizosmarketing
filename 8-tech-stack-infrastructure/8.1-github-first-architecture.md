# GitHub-First Technical Architecture

## Core Philosophy: GitHub Is Everything

### What This Means
- **Product delivery:** GitHub repos
- **Customer management:** GitHub issues
- **Documentation:** GitHub wikis/markdown
- **Automation:** GitHub Actions
- **Version control:** Obviously Git

### What This Doesn't Mean
- Everything literally in GitHub (use right tools)
- Forcing GitHub where it doesn't fit
- Ignoring customer experience for purity

    A[Customer Visits Landing Page] --> B[Clicks Buy]
    B --> C[Stripe Checkout]
    C --> D[Payment Success]
    D --> E[Webhook to GitHub Action]
    E --> F[Create Customer Repo]

    E --> H[Invite to Slack]
    F --> I[Transfer Repo Ownership]
    G --> J[Onboarding Sequence]
    H --> K[Community Access]
```

### Technical Implementation

**1. Stripe Webhook → GitHub Action**
```yaml
name: New Customer Onboarding
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [stripe_payment_success]

jobs:
  onboard:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create Customer Repo
        run: |
          gh repo create ${{ github.event.client_payload.customer_email }}-biz-os \
            --private \
            --template BuildThingsThatBuildThings/biz-os-template
      
      - name: Personalize Repository
        run: |
          # Update YAML with customer data
          # Commit changes
          # Transfer ownership
```

**2. ConvertKit Integration**
- Tag customer on purchase
- Trigger onboarding sequence
- Weekly tips and updates
- Community highlights

**3. Slack Auto-Invite**
- Webhook from Stripe
- Auto-generate invite
- Add to #welcome channel
- Assign onboarding buddy

---

## Security & Compliance

### Customer Data Protection
- **Stripe:** Handles all payment data (PCI compliant)
- **GitHub:** Private repos until transferred
- **ConvertKit:** Email data encrypted
- **Passwords:** Never stored, OAuth only

### Access Control
- **2FA required** on all accounts
- **API keys** in GitHub Secrets
- **Webhook signatures** verified
- **Customer repos** transferred immediately

### Backup Strategy
- **Code:** Git = distributed backup
- **Customer data:** Stripe = source of truth
- **Content:** GitHub + local clones
- **Email lists:** ConvertKit export weekly

---

- Post in team channel

### Zapier/Make Connections

**Stripe → ConvertKit**

## Scaling Architecture

### 0-100 Customers
- Current stack handles perfectly
- Manual touches still valuable
- Focus on product quality

### 100-1,000 Customers  
- Add Crisp for live chat
- Upgrade Slack to paid
- Consider dedicated support tool
- Add monitoring (Sentry)

### 1,000+ Customers
- Custom dashboard needed
- API for partners
- Enterprise GitHub plan
- Dedicated infrastructure

---

## Disaster Recovery

### If GitHub Goes Down
- Local repos = full backup
- Customer impact minimal (they have repos)
- Support moves to email
- Updates via ConvertKit

### If Stripe Goes Down
- No new sales (rare)
- Existing customers unaffected
- Manual invoicing backup
- Crypto payment option?

### If Everything Burns
- Customer repos are distributed
- Email list in ConvertKit
- Rebuild from documentation
- Community rallies

---

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-automation

# 2. Build and test locally
./scripts/test-local.sh

# 3. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/new-automation

# 4. GitHub Action runs tests
# 5. Merge to main
# 6. Auto-deploy to all systems
```

### Documentation Standards
- Everything in markdown
- Screenshots for complex steps
- Video for critical paths
- Update with every change

## 💰 Tax Optimization

### Current Strategy
1. **LLC with S-Corp Election**
   - Self-employment tax savings: ~$15K/year
   - Reasonable salary: $75K
   - Distributions: Remainder

2. **Deductions Maximized**
   - Home office: $500/month
   - Technology: 100% business use
   - Travel: Documented business purpose
   - Education: Direct business benefit

3. **Retirement Contributions**
   - Solo 401(k): $22,500 employee + 25% profit sharing
   - Total potential: ~$66,000/year

## 🛡️ Asset Protection

### Current Measures
1. **Operating Agreement**: Comprehensive, single-member
2. **Business Insurance**: General liability + E&O
3. **Separate Accounts**: Business vs. personal
4. **IP Assignment**: All IP assigned to company

### Future Considerations
- Holding company structure (at $1M revenue)
- Trademark registration (brand assets)
- Patent applications (unique frameworks)
- International structure (if expanding)

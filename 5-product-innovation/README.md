# 5-product-innovation â€“ System Blueprint

## ðŸ§  Purpose
Build the GitHub Business OS that makes $97K consultants obsolete. We're creating a product that literally runs businesses from a GitHub repo - and we're using our own system to build it.

## âœ… Must-Haves
* MVP GitHub Business OS repo (10 core domains)
* YAML personalization engine working
* One-click deployment process
* Documentation that doesn't suck
* 10 beta customers validating before launch

## ðŸŒŸ Nice-to-Haves
* GitHub Actions automation library
* Community contribution framework
* Vertical-specific templates
* White-label partner program
* SaaS companion app

## ðŸ§¨ Distractions
* Feature creep before launch
* Building for enterprise (they're not our market)
* Perfect code (ship fast, iterate)
* Competing on features vs category creation

## ðŸ§­ OODA Orientation
**Observe** â€“ Beta customer usage patterns, consultant pricing, GitHub adoption rates  
**Orient** â€“ We're creating a new category, not competing on features  
**Decide** â€“ MVP features that prove the concept  
**Act** â€“ Ship weekly, gather feedback, iterate

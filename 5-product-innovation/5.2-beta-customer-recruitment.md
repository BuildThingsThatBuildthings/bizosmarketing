## The Beta Recruitment Message

### Version A: The Direct Approach

**Subject/DM:** Turning your business chaos into a GitHub repo (beta)

```
Hey [Name],

Saw your post about [specific pain point they mentioned].

I'm building something that might help:

A complete business operating system that runs from GitHub.
Not templates. Not courses. Actual working systems.

- Your entire business in one repo
- YAML variables customize everything  
- Automation built in
- Version control for operations

Looking for 10 beta users who:
‚úì Run $10K-$100K businesses
‚úì Comfortable with basic GitHub
‚úì Tired of scattered operations
‚úì Can implement in next 30 days

Beta deal: $47 (50% off launch price)
You get: Complete system + direct founder access
I get: Feedback + testimonial

Interested?

-Ryan
```

### Version B: The Story Approach

```
Quick story:

Last year I paid a consultant $15K for "business systems."

Got PDFs.
No implementation.
Still chaos.

So I built my own solution:
Put my entire business in a GitHub repo.

Revenue up 40%.
Working 30 hours instead of 60.
Everything automated.

Now I'm packaging it for others.

Looking for 10 beta testers at 50% off.

You in?
```

### Version C: The Problem/Solution

```
Do any of these sound familiar?

- 17 different tools that don't talk
- Spreadsheets held together with formulas and prayer  
- Working IN the business, not ON it
- Consultants quoting $50K+ for basic systems

I turned my entire business into a GitHub repo.

10 domains. 100+ templates. Total automation.

Beta testing with 10 entrepreneurs.
$47 to completely systematize your business.

DM if you want in.
```

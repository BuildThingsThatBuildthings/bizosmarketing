# Creating the "GitHub Business OS" Category

## The Old World (Where Everyone's Stuck)

### How Businesses "Systematize" Today
1. **Hire a consultant** → Get PDFs → Never implement → Stay chaotic
2. **Buy 47 tools** → None connect → More chaos than before
3. **Use templates** → Static documents → Outdated in a week
4. **Build from scratch** → 300 hours → Still missing pieces

### The Unspoken Truth
Every business tool today assumes you're either:
- Enterprise (can afford $100K consultants)
- Hobbyist (happy with free templates)
- Stupid (need hand-holding forever)

Nobody builds for the **GitHub-literate solopreneur** who just wants their business to work.

## The New World We're Creating

### GitHub Business OS: A New Category

**Definition:** Your entire business operation versioned, automated, and controlled through GitHub - just like your code.

**Core Principles:**
1. **Version Control Everything** - Your business should have commit history
2. **Automation First** - If it's repetitive, it should be automated
3. **Own Your Stack** - No vendor lock-in, no monthly fees
4. **Fork and Deploy** - Running in hours, not months

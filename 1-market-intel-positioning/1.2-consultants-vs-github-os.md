# The $97 GitHub OS vs $97,000 Consultants

## The Brutal Truth About Business Consultants

### What $50K Actually Gets You
1. **Week 1-2:** Discovery calls (aka billing you to learn your business)
2. **Week 3-6:** PowerPoint deck creation (aka fancy common sense)
3. **Week 7-10:** "Implementation planning" (aka more meetings)
4. **Week 11-12:** Handoff of PDFs you'll never use
5. **Week 13+:** They ghost you, invoice paid

### What Our $97 Gets You
1. **Hour 1:** Complete business OS downloaded
2. **Hour 2:** Customized with your company details
3. **Hour 3:** First systems running
4. **Day 2:** Entire operation systematized
5. **Forever:** You own it, update it, scale it

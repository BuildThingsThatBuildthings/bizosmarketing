## Battle Cards

### "It's too cheap to be good"
**Response:** "That's exactly what consultants charging $50K want you to think. We've just removed their overhead, travel costs, and PowerPoint theater. The system is the same - the delivery is 100x more efficient."

### "I need something custom"
**Response:** "Every file uses YAML variables for instant customization. Plus, it's a GitHub repo - you can modify anything. Try getting that flexibility from a consultant's PDF."

### "What about support?"
**Response:** "Community of 200+ entrepreneurs using the same system. Plus, everything is documented. Most consultants disappear after the check clears."

### "I've tried templates before"
**Response:** "Templates are ingredients. We're giving you the entire restaurant including the recipes, kitchen layout, and automation. Completely different game."

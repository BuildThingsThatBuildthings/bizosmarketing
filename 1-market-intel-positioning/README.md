# 1-market-intel-positioning â€“ System Blueprint

## ðŸ§  Purpose
Positioning GitHub-based Business OS as the category-defining solution that makes $97K consulting obsolete. We're not competing on features - we're creating a new way to systematize businesses.

## âœ… Must-Haves
* Weekly tracking of "business operating system" search trends
* Monthly interviews with customers who chose us over consultants
* Competitor pricing movements (especially new GitHub-based tools)
* ICP validation metrics from our 85 active customers
* Category creation progress tracking

## ðŸŒŸ Nice-to-Haves
* Automated alerts when consultants mention "GitHub for business"
* Social listening for "scattered operations" pain points
* Partnership opportunities with dev tool companies
* Influencer identification in solopreneur space

## ðŸ§¨ Distractions
* Generic business software competitors (Monday, Asana)
* Template marketplaces without systems thinking
* Course creators teaching theory vs implementation
* Enterprise solutions we'll never compete with

## ðŸ§­ OODA Orientation
**Observe** â€“ Search volume for "GitHub business systems", consultant pricing, customer implementation success  
**Orient** â€“ We're creating a category, not competing in existing ones  
**Decide** â€“ Double down on "$97 not $97K" positioning  
**Act** â€“ Launch category education campaign, case studies, comparison content

- [x] Competitive intel tracker (consultants vs us)
- [ ] Market sizing calculator for GitHub-literate solopreneurs

* Sales call recordings mentioning competitors

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics

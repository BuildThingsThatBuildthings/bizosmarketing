## The Perfect Customer: Tech-Savvy Solopreneur Sarah

### Core Profile
- **Revenue:** $50K-$150K/year (hitting operational ceiling)
- **Tech Comfort:** Already uses GitHub for something (even just storage)
- **Business Type:** Digital services, SaaS, consulting, or info products
- **Pain Level:** 8/10 - actively losing money due to chaos
- **Buying Power:** Can make $97 decision instantly
- **Implementation Speed:** Will deploy within 48 hours of purchase

### The "Hell Yes" Indicators
1. **Already tried:** Notion templates, Airtable, Monday.com
2. **Frustrated by:** Scattered tools that don't connect
3. **Loves:** Version control, automation, owning their stack
4. **Hates:** Monthly SaaS fees, vendor lock-in, consultants
5. **Dreams of:** Business that runs without them

## Primary Persona: GitHub Gary

**"I already use GitHub for my code, why not my entire business?"**

### Daily Reality
- 6 AM: Checks 4 different tools for business metrics
- 9 AM: Loses track of a client project across Notion/Slack/Email
- 2 PM: Manually updates spreadsheets that should be automated
- 6 PM: Realizes he spent zero time on growth, again
- 9 PM: Googles "business automation" but everything's too expensive

### GitHub Usage
- Has 10+ repos (mostly side projects)
- Comfortable with markdown, YAML, basic Git
- Wishes everything had version control
- Already tracks some business stuff in private repos

### Trigger Moment
"Wait, I can run my ENTIRE business from GitHub for $97?"

### Objections We'll Face
1. "Is this too technical?" → No, if you can commit, you can business
2. "What about support?" → Community + docs beat consultant ghosting
3. "Why not just use Notion?" → Show them version control + automation

## Secondary Persona: Scattered Susan

**"I'm drowning in tools and none of them talk to each other"**

### Current Tool Stack (aka Tool Hell)
- CRM: HubSpot free tier (barely using 10%)
- Projects: Trello (abandoned after 2 months)
- Docs: Google Drive (chaos folder structure)
- Finances: Excel + hopes and prayers
- Automation: What automation?

### Why She Buys
- Sees "entire business in one repo" and almost cries
- $97 vs her current $200/month tool subscriptions
- Friend showed her their GitHub Business OS
- Tired of duct-taping tools together

### Success Metrics
- Cancels 5+ tool subscriptions
- Revenue up 30% from found time
- Actually takes a vacation
- Becomes evangelist for the system

## Tertiary Persona: Consultant Carl

**"I preach systems but my own business is chaos"**

### The Irony
- Charges $5K/month for business systems consulting
- His own business held together with spreadsheets
- Knows he needs systems but "too busy" to build them
- Would be embarrassed if clients saw his operations

### Perfect Fit Because
- Can implement immediately (high technical skill)
- Becomes case study for his own clients
- White-labels our system for his consulting
- Price is a rounding error for him

- Will give up at first Git error

### 2. Enterprise Eric  
- Needs 47 approvals to buy
- Wants custom features
- Requires SOC2 compliance
- Thinks $97 = low quality

### 3. Wantrepreneur William

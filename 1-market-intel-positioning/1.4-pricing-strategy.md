# GitHub Business OS Pricing Strategy

## Core Pricing Philosophy

### The $97 Price Point Psychology

**Why exactly $97?**
1. **Under $100** - No budget approval needed
2. **Not $99** - We're not playing retail games
3. **Serious enough** - Free = not valued
4. **10x rule** - Worth $970+ in time saved week 1
5. **Anchor friendly** - $97 vs $97,000 is memorable

### What We're Really Selling
- **Time:** 40 hours/month saved = $4,000 value
- **Clarity:** Mental bandwidth recovered = priceless
- **Growth:** 35% revenue increase average = $3,500/month
- **Freedom:** Business runs without you = life changing

**Total value: $7,500+/month**
**Our price: $97 once**
**Value ratio: 927:1 first year**

## Psychological Pricing Triggers

### Anchoring Strategy
```
McKinsey: $125,000 → $97 (99.92% discount)
Deloitte: $75,000 → $97 (99.87% discount)
Boutique: $25,000 → $97 (99.61% discount)
Course: $2,997 → $97 (96.76% discount)
Our Price: $97 (Actual value: $7,500+)
```

### Urgency Without Lying
- "Join 237 entrepreneurs" (social proof)
- "Consultants are studying our model" (FOMO)
- "Price locked for 2025" (future increase implied)
- "Community seats limited" (Slack has limits)

### Risk Reversal
**30-Day Guarantee**
"If you implement and don't save 10x the price in time or money, full refund."

**Why we can offer this:**
- 3% refund rate historical
- All were non-implementers
- Implementation = success
- Cost of acquisition > cost of refund

## Objection Handling by Price

### "It's too cheap to be good"
**Response:** "That's what happens when you remove consultant overhead, offices, and PowerPoint theater. The system is the same, the delivery is 100x more efficient."

### "Why not free?"
**Response:** "Free means you won't implement. $97 means you have skin in the game. Plus, we need to eat while we destroy the consulting industry."

### "Why not subscription?"
**Response:** "Because we're not parasites. You buy once, own forever, succeed independently. That's the whole point."

### "Can I get a discount?"
**Response:** "The discount is built in. This is 99.9% off consultant prices. If $97 breaks your budget, you need our system more than anyone."
